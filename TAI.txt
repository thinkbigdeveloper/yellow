TAI, (c)2014 Dave Nadel

TAI is born.  Turing AI


A Client-facing AI system to "tour" users through KVA's (key valued actions) on a site.  

Called from HEADER script tag for every HTML page.  Must be inserted into code by Webmaster, or as Plugin for Wordpress, Joomla.

Once installed, clients can select pages of their website (and elements?) and assign them to a TAI, a sequential suggested content consumption pattern that the site serves up on the fly to each user, based on rules by Client and built-in rules.

Assignable by Client: 
Pages
Divs (?)

TAI operates as transparent site overlay.
